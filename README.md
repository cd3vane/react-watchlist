[![Cypress Tests](https://github.com/cd3vane/watchlist/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cd3vane/watchlist/actions/workflows/main.yml)
# React with Typescript Watchlist

## [Live Demo](https://cd3vane.github.io/watchlist)

## Features
- Search for movies using TMDB API 
- Add movie to watchlist or watched list
- Using localstorage to store lists

## What I learned
- How to use typescript types to catch errors in development faster
- How to use useRender and useContext hooks with typescript
- How to use cypress for end-to-end testing
- Using github actions with cypress to automate testing when pushing commits

## Goal
- Practice these techniques before refactoring and expanding my [movie app](https://github.com/cd3vane/movie-app-v2) to include typescript and testing
